Mi name Deng, straight outta South Sudan, just doing my ting init,

Mi deh yah, working pon JavaScript day by day.

Nuttin’ too serious — just coding, learning, and leveling up quiet-quiet.

Preparing for full-stack when de time right but mi nah rush it.

Step by step…

*Right now mi dealing with*

• Pure JavaScript business

• Building likkle projects fi keep di brain sharp

• Solving problems without stress

• Preparing fi di bigger tings later (Node.js, TypeScript,Next.js,Express.js,Koa.js, React… one step at a time)

Mi stay humble, mi stay growing.

Who fi see di work, will see it, Amen.
